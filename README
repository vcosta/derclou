To compile:
===========
You need SDL installed. Type 'make' to compile.


Instructions:
=============

To run the game type 'derclou'.

Here is the command line usage:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax:
        derclou [-h] [-d[<num>]] [-f] [-m<num>] [-s<num>]
Flags:
        -d[<num>]  - enable debug output (debug level [1])
        -f         - fullscreen mode
        -g<mode>   - graphics mode (normal,2x,linear2x)
        -h         - show help
        -m<num>    - set music volume to <num> (0-255)
        -s<num>    - set sfx volume to <num> (0-255)
        -t         - trainer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Implementation:
===============

* The game autodetects the following data files:

  a) Der Clou!
  b) Der Clou! CD-ROM
  c) Der Clou! Profidisk
  d) Der Clou! Profidisk CD-ROM

  PC version only.

  It also autodetects the language: German/English/French/Spanish/Slovak.

* The game tries to load the datafiles from the directory pointed by
  the environment variable 'DERCLOU_ROOTDIR'.
  Failing that it will try to load them from the current directory.

  ('DERCLOU_ROOTDIR' seems busted. Please use the current directory for now.)

  The free datafiles (German) can no longer be downloaded from the neo website.
  The website has been down for some time. I put these files in a tarball here:
  http://vasc.home.sapo.pt/theclue/

  Just 'cd' into the created directory and run 'derclou' to play.

* The English datafiles have not been released by neo Software since they
  do not own the copyright for them. Not that you should have much trouble
  finding them.


Request:
========

If you like this software please contact neo Software Produktions GmbH and help
me persuade them to re-release the source code under an actual open source
license like the GNU GPL. Be nice to them.

Enjoy!
